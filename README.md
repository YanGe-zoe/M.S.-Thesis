1. **Overview of existing viscosity measurement methods and conceptualization of the proposed microfluidic-based viscosity detection system**

  These methods can be divided into:
- Traditional viscosity measurement approaches
- Novel MEMS-based approaches
- Novel microfluidic-based approaches

2. **Design and simulation of the microfluidic viscosity measurement chip**
</p>
As shown in **Figure 4**, a novel variable cross-section microfluidic chip is designed.  
It consists of a narrow slit-shaped small cross-section and a rectangular large cross-section.  
This structure eliminates the need for microscope observation, as an industrial camera can be used instead.

Using COMSOL, the flow velocity at the channel centerline was simulated.  
It can be observed that the velocity varies with changes in the supply pressure system (**Figure 5**).

  Furthermore, the chip was fabricated using stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing.  
Characterization with a Zygo interferometer confirmed good molding quality and compliance with experimental requirements (**Figure 6**).

3.Fabrication and calibration of the microfluidic chip

4.Construction of a high-throughput viscosity measurement system

5.Calibration and experimental validation of the viscosity measurement platform

The main innovative work and achievements of this thesis are as follows:
1.	A variable cross-section microfluidic chip design was proposed. Using photocuring 3D printing technology, a layered fabrication method for the microfluidic chip was developed, overcoming the limitations of traditional constant cross-section designs that rely on microscopic equipment and suffer from low measurement accuracy.
2.	A high-throughput viscosity measurement system based on the microfluidic chip was designed. By connecting multiple gas channels to a chip holder, parallel multi-channel measurements were realized, significantly improving detection efficiency
