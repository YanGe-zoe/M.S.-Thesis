# M.S.-Thesis

The thesis is structured around the following logical framework:

1.Overview of existing viscosity measurement methods and conceptualization of the proposed microfluidic-based viscosity detection system

2.Design and simulation of the microfluidic viscosity measurement chip

3.Fabrication and characterization of the microfluidic chip

4.Construction of a high-throughput viscosity measurement system

5.Calibration and experimental validation of the viscosity detection platform
