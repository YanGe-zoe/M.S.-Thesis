1. **Overview of existing viscosity measurement methods and conceptualization of the proposed microfluidic-based viscosity detection system**

  These methods can be divided into:
- Traditional viscosity measurement approaches
- Novel MEMS-based approaches
- Novel microfluidic-based approaches

2. **Design and simulation of the microfluidic viscosity measurement chip**


3.Fabrication and calibration of the microfluidic chip

4.Construction of a high-throughput viscosity measurement system

5.Calibration and experimental validation of the viscosity measurement platform

The main innovative work and achievements of this thesis are as follows:
1.	A variable cross-section microfluidic chip design was proposed. Using photocuring 3D printing technology, a layered fabrication method for the microfluidic chip was developed, overcoming the limitations of traditional constant cross-section designs that rely on microscopic equipment and suffer from low measurement accuracy.
2.	A high-throughput viscosity measurement system based on the microfluidic chip was designed. By connecting multiple gas channels to a chip holder, parallel multi-channel measurements were realized, significantly improving detection efficiency
